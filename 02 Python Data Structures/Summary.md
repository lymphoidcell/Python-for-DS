| **Using a List as a Queue**               | Implementing FIFO using lists.                                         |
| **Using a List as a Stack**               | Implementing LIFO using lists.                                         |
| **Using Lists and Stacks for NLP**        | Example: Parentheses balancing.                                        |
| **Making Improvements with List Comprehensions** | Creating lists using comprehensions vs. traditional loops.         |
| **Tuples**                                | Creating and accessing tuples, immutability.                           |
| **A List of Tuples**                      | Complex data structures with lists containing tuples.                  |
| **Immutability**                          | Demonstrating immutability of tuples vs. mutability of lists.           |
| **Dictionaries**                          | Creating and accessing dictionaries.                                   |
| **A List of Dictionaries**                | Complex data structures with lists containing dictionaries.            |
| **Adding to a Dictionary with `setdefault()`** | Using `setdefault()` to add key-value pairs.                      |

| **Sets**                                  | Creating and using sets, uniqueness of elements.                       |
| **Removing Duplicates from Sequences**    | Using sets and `dict.fromkeys()` to remove duplicates.                 |
| **Performing Common Set Operations**      | Union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference.                 |
